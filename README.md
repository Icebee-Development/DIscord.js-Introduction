## Introduction

This guide makes a best effort attempt at humanizing the use of the Discord.js library, in its current version 13 iteration.

In this guide we make every effort to _teach_ you how to use the library and how to extend it with your own code. We do, however expect you to have a basic understanding of JavaScript before attempting to write bots. Discord.js \(and other discord libraries\) require some median-to-advanced concepts that might be hard to grasp for anyone that doesn't have a good footing with the language.
